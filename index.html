            <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
            <p>According to PEW Research<sup>1</sup>, 96% of adults between 18-29 occasionally consult reviews before making a
                purchase. But does this mean that higher ratings result in more product sales? Specifically, what do
                higher ratings indicate for video game sales? Maybe higher ratings lead to more game sales. But could
                some more obscure games with a dedicated group of followers receive higher ratings than popular
                games with significant sales volume? I am also curious whether there has been an increase in the
                production of games in recent years and, if so, what affect this increase has on the quality of games
                based on review scores. Is it possible that an increase in the number of games results in review scores
                decreasing with the oversaturation of video game releases?</p>
            <p>In this project, I plan to use Metacritic’s user and critic review scores to see if there is a correlation
                between the scores of a game and its overall sales. I will be joining the review data with sales data
                obtained from VGChartz.</p>

            <h2> 2. Data </h2>
            <p>This project uses two primary sources of data: Metacritic’s<sup>2</sup> game critic and game player review scores
                of different games and VGChartz<sup>3</sup> data about video game sales.</p>
            <h3> 2.1 Review Scores </h3>
            <p>I collected data from Metacritic, which contained user (user score) and critic (meta score) review scores
                for each game.
                Metacritic’s data was found on 186 different web pages. I wrote a web crawling script to collect all data
                across these 186 pages. I collected the game title, summary, platform, user score, meta score, and
                release date for 18,526 games. Some of the results were the same game that was released on different
                platforms, which is essential to consider when I begin merging the data. I created a data frame which is
                contained in the Metacritic.csv file in the project folder. The web crawling script that I wrote is
                contained in the metacritic.R file in the project folder.
                The data didn’t need much cleaning; however, to make the platform match with the VGChartz data, I
                created a dictionary to convert Metacritic’s platform data to match VGChartz. This cleaning was done in
                the file combining_vgs.R.</p>
