            <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
            <p>According to PEW Research<sup>1</sup>, 96% of adults between 18-29 occasionally consult reviews before making a
                purchase. But does this mean that higher ratings result in more product sales? Specifically, what do
                higher ratings indicate for video game sales? Maybe higher ratings lead to more game sales. But could
                some more obscure games with a dedicated group of followers receive higher ratings than popular
                games with significant sales volume? I am also curious whether there has been an increase in the
                production of games in recent years and, if so, what affect this increase has on the quality of games
                based on review scores. Is it possible that an increase in the number of games results in review scores
                decreasing with the oversaturation of video game releases?</p>
            <p>In this project, I plan to use Metacritic’s user and critic review scores to see if there is a correlation
                between the scores of a game and its overall sales. I will be joining the review data with sales data
                obtained from VGChartz.</p>
